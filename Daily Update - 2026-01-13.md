## Work Items Summary: Three Vendor Quotes in Progress

**Context:** All three active work items are quote requests assigned to Edgar Ladaga, reported by you, and in progress with **medium priority**. These span networking and timing synchronization hardware across multiple vendor relationships.

**Item 1 – Microchip Timing Synchronization (SCR-630):** Awaiting vendor response on a quote for the Microchip SyncServer S650. Edgar has already followed up with the vendor, indicating this item is active but dependent on external input. **Status: Waiting** — no immediate action required unless vendor communication stalls.

**Item 2 – NVIDIA Network Switching (SCR-482):** Quote for the full NVIDIA Spectrum SN switch product line requires a price list covering 8 switch models. This appears to be the most information-dependent of the three and may benefit from a targeted follow-up to clarify which models are priority. **Status: Blocked on vendor details** — consider if Keysight Network Test Overview Discussion (today, 2:30–3:30 PM) or Network Sync (today, 1:00–2:00 PM) provides relevant context or contacts.

**Item 3 – Arista Optical Transceivers (SCR-474):** Arista is actively quoting the 400ZR QSFP-DD transceiver module, with 2 units already available at the Zanker location. This item has the most concrete progress (inventory identified). **Status: In vendor quoting** — may be ready for closure once formal quote arrives.

**Cross-Reference:** These three quotes collectively address network infrastructure components and should be tracked as a related effort. If any are tied to specific projects or upcoming infrastructure deployments, consider grouping them in a single vendor or project update to Edgar to streamline follow-ups.

## Today's Focus Areas

**Immediate Priorities:**
- **11:30 AM–12:15 PM:** CtP & CtB BoM Alignment — prepare bill-of-materials alignment points; may inform quote prioritization if any of the three vendor items are BoM-related.
- **12:00–12:30 PM:** SMC L11 Rack Manifest Requirements — hardware manifest discussion; confirm whether Arista, NVIDIA, or Microchip items map to this specification.
- **1:00–2:00 PM:** Network Sync — validate network strategy against NVIDIA Spectrum SN quote scope.
- **2:30–3:30 PM:** Keysight Network Test Overview — potential opportunity to align test requirements with incoming quotes.

**Leadership & Cross-Functional Touchpoints:**
- Monthly 1:1 (5:00–5:40 PM), Benson/Jason introduction (5:45–6:25 PM), bi-weekly with David (6:30–7:10 PM) — use these to surface any blockers on the three quotes or escalate if vendor responses are delayed.
