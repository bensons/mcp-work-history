## Friday, January 16, 2026

## Today's Focus (Remaining Hours)

You have a **packed afternoon of meetings** transitioning from your out-of-office period back into operations. The day culminates with five consecutive engagements spanning 10:30 AM through 5:30 PM—a critical day for stakeholder alignment and decision-making on two major customer projects.

**Key preparation needed:** Gary Wicker interview (Senior Software Engineer, Networking role) requires advance context; this may connect to your MSR and NVIDIA backbone initiatives.

## Strategic Work Priorities

### **Critical Path Items (Highest Priority)**

**1. NET-967: Customer Opportunity: Microsoft Research (MSR)**
- Status: In Progress
- Context: This is your MSR customer project epic. You have MSR engagements scheduled for Jan 20 (11:45 AM briefing, tentative) and a debrief with Gary Wicker following.
- Action: Use today's interview with Gary to assess networking requirements for MSR scope. This directly feeds into next week's MSR briefing preparation.

**2. NET-758: Edge Design for NVIDIA Backbone Support**
- Status: In Progress
- Context: Part of the Cambiar (NVIDIA) customer project, linked to Comet Readiness. You have alignment meetings scheduled for Jan 20.
- Action: Prepare edge design specifications for the CtP & CtB BoM Alignment meeting (Jan 20, 11:30 AM). This is essential for technical design freeze.

**3. NET-1350: FW Change Request [LAX01-CL02] - SoSmart Traffic**
- Status: Done (but unresolved, waiting for debug)
- Context: Firewall change for SoSmart Server from AWS to net-mgmt. This is operationally blocking.
- Action: Prioritize obtaining debug information today or Monday to move this to resolution. This may require escalation if debug is blocked.

### **Supporting Work (Medium Priority)**

**NET-764: Global Backbone Project Task**
- Status: In Progress
- Note: Lower immediate priority but should be monitored for dependencies with NVIDIA and MSR initiatives.

## Meeting Agenda & Preparation

| Time | Meeting | Preparation Priority | Notes |
|------|---------|----------------------|-------|
| **10:30–11:00 AM** | Network Sync | Medium | Routine operational sync—use this to surface any blockers on NET-1350 (SoSmart firewall debug) |
| **11:30 AM–12:00 PM** | SMC L11 Rack Manifest Requirements | Medium | Confirm manifest documentation is current for operational handoff |
| **12:00–12:30 PM** | Interview: Gary Wicker (Senior Software Engineer, Networking) | **High** | This is your key technical assessment for networking roles. Likely connects to NET-967 (MSR) and NET-758 (NVIDIA) staffing/capability needs. Probe his experience with edge networking design and customer project dynamics. |
| **1:00–1:40 PM** | Benson/Jason Monthly | Medium | Standing monthly—likely operational sync on team/project status |
| **2:00–2:50 PM** | Richard/Benson Bi-weekly | Medium | Likely cross-functional alignment; bring NET-758 (NVIDIA edge design) status |
| **3:00–3:50 PM** | Benson/Long Bi-weekly | Medium | Ensure you have updated status on both customer projects (MSR, NVIDIA) |
| **4:00–4:25 PM** | Dylan/Benson 1:1 Monthly | Medium | Team-level check-in; surface any blockers from Dylan's work |
| **5:00–5:30 PM** | Nikita:Benson Bi-weekly | Medium | Final stakeholder alignment of the day |

## Next Week Priorities (Jan 20–22)

**Monday, Jan 20** is your alignment and debrief day:
- **MSR briefing & debrief sequence** (11:45 AM briefing, 12:30–1:00 PM debrief with Gary Wicker)—this validates whether Gary's assessment from today informs MSR requirements
- **CtP & CtB BoM Alignment (11:30 AM)**—NET-758 (NVIDIA edge design) must have completed design input before this meeting
- **Week Planning - SDN Networking (12:00–12:30 PM, tentative)**—use this to lock down technical direction for both customer projects

**Thursday, Jan 22**: Social engagement (Thirdsdays, 7:00–8:00 PM)—team morale/informal networking opportunity.

## Critical Blockers & Dependencies

| Blocker | Impact | Action |
|---------|--------|--------|
| NET-1350 (SoSmart firewall debug pending) | Operational—prevents customer traffic routing | Escalate for debug today; if unavailable, prepare Monday action plan |
| NET-758 (NVIDIA edge design) | Must complete before Jan 20 BoM alignment | Lock in design specs this weekend or Monday morning |
| Gary Wicker assessment today | Informs MSR staffing/capability planning | Document interview findings immediately for Jan 20 debrief |

---

## Immediate Actions (Today)

1. **During Network Sync (10:30 AM):** Request status update on NET-1350 firewall debug—determine if external dependency or internal issue.
2. **Gary Wicker Interview (12:00 PM):** Focus on edge networking expertise and experience with enterprise customer projects. Record decision on hiring/resource fit for NVIDIA initiative.
3. **End of day:** Consolidate interview notes and preliminary assessment for Monday's MSR debrief.
