# Daily Briefing - January 11, 2026

## Week Overview

The week ahead is moderately paced with a significant meeting concentration on **January 12**, featuring 11 back-to-back sessions spanning 8 hours and 50 minutes. Activity tapers considerably midweek, with a notably light schedule on **January 13**. A **medical appointment (Colonoscopy) is scheduled for January 15** from 8:00–10:30 AM, which will occupy your morning. Today (January 11) is designated as a personal day, providing recovery time before the demanding Monday schedule.

## Priority Work Items & Meeting Connections

**Three initiatives hold highest priority status:**

• **NET-1350: Firewall change for SoSmart Server** – Currently awaiting debug information before advancement
• **NET-967: Microsoft Research opportunity** – In active progress
• **NET-758: NVIDIA backbone support design** – In active progress

**Medium priority:**

• **NET-764: Backbone design document** – In active progress

Tomorrow's meetings directly intersect with these work streams. The **Week Planning - SDN Networking** session (10:00 AM) and **Lambda<>HRT Network Design Call** (1:00 PM) will likely provide opportunities to advance NET-758 and NET-764. The **Deployments Standup** (11:30 AM) focusing on SEA-01/MCI-01 may offer relevant infrastructure updates. The **Technical Leadership** meeting (3:00 PM) may address NET-1350's debug status or strategic alignment of the three highest-priority items.

## Tomorrow's Focus Areas

Monday's agenda centers on infrastructure planning and team coordination:

• **Infrastructure & Architecture:** SDN networking planning, Lambda-HRT network design, and deployment coordination
• **Operational Synchronization:** Device naming conventions and deployment status alignment
• **Team Development:** Introduction and onboarding of new team member Ankit (5:00 PM)

## Preparation Notes

**For Monday's meetings, consider:**

• Consolidating any pending questions or blockers on NET-1350 to raise during Technical Leadership or relevant technical calls
• Preparing talking points on NET-967 and NET-758 status for Week Planning and network design discussions
• Ensuring NET-764 backbone design documentation is accessible if referenced during infrastructure planning sessions
• Coordinating onboarding materials for Ankit's introduction meeting
