# Executive Briefing: Week of January 15-22, 2026

## Overview

Your week focuses on personal health today, followed by high-impact project work and critical stakeholder engagement leading into your Seattle trip. Three highest-priority work items (all related to customer projects and infrastructure) require attention before travel, with strategic meetings aligned to project momentum.

## Critical Priorities & Dependencies

**Active Customer Deliverables Requiring Focus:**
- **Microsoft Research (NET-967):** Epic-level customer opportunity currently in progress with MSR Retro scheduled for today (declined due to health appointment). This project carries dependency weight for the week's planning.
- **NVIDIA Backbone Support (NET-758):** Design phase in progress under Cambiar customer project. Alignment with Global Backbone Edge Design (NET-764) suggests these tasks may share technical dependencies.
- **Completed Infrastructure Work (NET-1350):** Firewall change for SoSmart Server traffic has moved to Done status—remove from active tracking.

**Week-Ahead Timeline:**
Your availability resets after today's medical appointment. Friday (Jan 16) shifts to home office with a concentration of biweekly stakeholder meetings (Jason, Richard, Long) that will likely surface MSR and NVIDIA project status. The Seattle work trip (Jan 21-25) follows INR on Jan 18, requiring closure or handoff on active deliverables by week's end.

## Meeting Schedule: January 15-22

| Date | Meeting | Status | Context |
|------|---------|--------|---------|

| **Jan 21-25** | Seattle work trip | — | — |

**Friday Meeting Cluster (Jan 16):** Three back-to-back biweekly touchpoints suggest potential MSR and NVIDIA project updates. Prepare brief status summaries on NET-967 and NET-758 before these conversations.

## Work Item Status & Connections

**Highest Priority Active Items:**
- **NET-967 (Microsoft Research):** In Progress. MSR Retro retrospective declined for today but likely surfaces in stakeholder meetings Friday. Ensure project status is current before Jason, Richard, and Long biweeklies.
- **NET-758 (NVIDIA Backbone):** In Progress under Cambiar project. Design phase work—confirm dependencies with Global Backbone Edge Design (NET-764, also in progress) are resolved before travel.

**Supporting Item:**
- **NET-764 (Global Backbone Edge Design):** In Progress. Potential technical dependency with NVIDIA work; may require coordination before Seattle trip departure.

## Action Items & Travel Prep

1. **Today (Jan 15):** Focus on recovery post-colonoscopy. Decline remaining declined meetings; review MSR project status asynchronously.
2. **Friday (Jan 16):** Prepare NET-967 (MSR) and NET-758 (NVIDIA) status summaries for biweekly meetings. Clarify any blocking dependencies between edge design items.
3. **Before Jan 21 Seattle Trip:** Confirm NET-967 and NET-758 project status is stable or has clear handoffs. Complete or delegate any blocking work items.
