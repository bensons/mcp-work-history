## Critical Work Items & Priorities

All four JIRA items carry **HIGHEST priority** designation and require focused attention before Tuesday's engagement-heavy schedule:

### Immediate Action Required: NET-1350 (Firewall Change Request)
This item is marked **Done but unresolved**, indicating a completion-to-closure gap. The LAX01-CL02 firewall change request permitting SoSmart traffic from AWS to net-mgmt infrastructure requires final resolution before the week's networking synchronization meetings. Recommend confirming closure status and addressing any blocking issues by end of business Monday.

### Active Strategic Initiatives: NET-967 & NET-758 (MSR Opportunity & NVIDIA Backbone)
Both remain in active progress and directly support Tuesday's client-facing activities. NET-967 (Customer Opportunity: Microsoft Research) connects directly to your 3:30–4:30 PM MSFT In-Person Agenda Review session, indicating this meeting represents a critical client touchpoint requiring current status updates. NET-758 (Edge Design for NVIDIA Backbone Support) falls within the Cambiar/NVIDIA project scope and may surface during networking synchronization discussions throughout the day.

### Foundational Support: NET-764 (Network Documentation)
Documentation for global backbone infrastructure remains in progress and provides essential reference material for multiple Tuesday meetings—particularly the Network Sync (1:00–2:00 PM) and Network Intake Process Sync (2:00–2:30 PM) sessions. Completing or validating documentation accuracy before Tuesday ensures you can reference current architecture during stakeholder discussions.

## Work-to-Meeting Alignment & Recommendations

### Pre-Tuesday Preparation Priority:
1. **By Monday end-of-day**: Resolve NET-1350 closure status; confirm final approvals for firewall change request
2. **By Monday evening**: Pull current NET-967 status and talking points for Microsoft engagement; review any recent correspondence or outstanding questions
3. **Before 3:30 PM Tuesday**: Ensure NET-758 edge design documentation is accessible for MSFT meeting context
4. **Before 1:00 PM Tuesday**: Have NET-764 global backbone documentation current for network synchronization discussions

### Meeting-Specific Guidance:
• The **12:30–1:00 PM debrief with Gary Wicker** (Networking) should inform priorities for the subsequent 1:00–2:00 PM Network Sync, creating a natural information flow
• The **3:30–4:30 PM MSFT meeting** is your highest-stakes client engagement; allocate 30–45 minutes Monday evening for preparation with NET-967 materials and any supporting collateral
• The **Network Intake Process Sync (2:00–2:30 PM)** provides an opportunity to address any process gaps identified in current work items
