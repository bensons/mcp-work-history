## Critical Priority: Procurement Status Heading into CtP & CtB Alignment

Your **January 13 CtP & CtB BoM Alignment** meeting (11:30 AM) will directly surface all three outstanding procurement items. You should be prepared with current status updates:

**Immediate attention required:**
- **SCR-482 (NVIDIA Spectrum Switches)** — This quote has been in progress since July 2025 and is dramatically overdue. You'll need to bring Edgar's latest status and a concrete resolution timeline to the BoM meeting. This covers 8 switch models and is foundational for infrastructure planning.

**Expected to resolve before meeting:**
- **SCR-630 (Microchip SyncServer S650)** — Currently awaiting vendor response within 48 hours. If timing aligns, this may resolve before Monday's alignment meeting.

**Tracking:**
- **SCR-474 (Arista 400ZR QSFP-DD transceiver)** — Arista is actively providing the quote. Confirm expected delivery date with Edgar before the meeting.

**Action:** Connect with Edgar today (Saturday) to confirm status on all three items and identify any blockers preventing SCR-482 progression. You'll want talking points ready for the BoM meeting about procurement velocity and risks.
