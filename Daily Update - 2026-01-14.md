## WORK ITEMS: Active Hardware Quotes

You have **three medium-priority quotes in progress**, all assigned to Edgar Ladaga and reported by Benson Schliesser. These are interconnected budgetary items for network infrastructure expansion:

### 1. NVIDIA Spectrum Switch Line (SCR-482) — *Most comprehensive scope*
Requires price list for all 8 Spectrum ethernet switch models (SN5610, SN5600, SN5600D, SN5400, SN4600C, SN4700, SN3420, SN2201). This is foundational for broader infrastructure planning and should be prioritized for completion before your Seattle trip.

### 2. Microchip SyncServer S650 (SCR-630) — *Awaiting vendor response*
Edgar contacted Microchip for business account quotes with a 48-hour response window expected from December 1. Status update needed: confirm response received or follow up if overdue. Required for initial budgetary planning (hardware + software licenses). This item may have already been received and needs verification.

### 3. Arista 400ZR QSFP-DD Transceiver (SCR-474) — *Long-standing, vendor-dependent*
Last update August 28, 2025 indicates Arista is still quoting on PN: 239-000020 (Innolight 400G QSFP-DD ZR, 120km; quantity 2 units in Zanker location). This is the oldest item and suggests a potential bottleneck—confirm current status with Edgar or Arista before travel.

**Cross-Reference Note**: All three quotes feed into infrastructure planning discussions at Infra Leads meetings (today and January 15). Have Edgar prepare summary status for both sessions—particularly note which vendor responses are still pending.

## THIS WEEK'S FOCUS

- **Medical leave**: Delegate urgent quote follow-ups to Edgar or designate backup coverage
- **Quote status verification**: Before Seattle trip, confirm Microchip and Arista responses or escalation status
- **Infra Leads sync inputs**: Ensure quote summaries are ready for meetings today and tomorrow to inform planning decisions
